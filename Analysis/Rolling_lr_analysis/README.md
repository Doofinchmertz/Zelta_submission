## data_prep.ipynb

This file, plots and checks various types of indicators.

## stat_inference.ipynb

This file looks at the correlation of a large pool of possible features with the target returns. We also use the OLS implementation of statsmodels library, to study the importance of each variable in our prediction problem. We also have a look and analyse the distribution of the original target variables and their values as predicted by the model.

## rolling_inference.ipynb

This file tests different aspects of the rolling linear regression idea (and its variants with regularization), and analyses how the number of true positives and false positives vary with different parameters.
